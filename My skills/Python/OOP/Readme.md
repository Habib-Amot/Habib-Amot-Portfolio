**WHAT IS OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMIN**
Object Oriented Programming is a programming technique that allows the writing of programs in such that it allows for modelling and mimick of real word objects.
In python we use the terms class, type, and data type interchangeably. In Python we can create custom classes that are fully integrated and that can be used just like the built-in data types. We have already encountered many classes, for example, dict, int, and str. We use the term object, and occasionally the term instance, to refer to an instance of a particular class. For example, 5 is an int object and "oblong" is a str object.
